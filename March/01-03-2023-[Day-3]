 Today I understand the vatious operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux) and how they works.
 
 I now understand the pros and cons of both open source and closed source software including how they works.
 
 I have come to understand the internet is the technical infrastructure that makes the web possible.
 it is used to connect billions of altogether with the help of internet service provider(ISP).
 
 The web works with hypertext transfer protocol(HTTP), Internet Protocol(IP)addresses, Domain Name System (DNS), code files (html,css, javascript and other web technologies), assets(PDF,Media,images.etc),clients and server in order for it to function properly.
 text-editors are key to any developer, therefore getting your hands wrap around them can enhance your code and give you less furstration.
 
 I now have basic understanding working with the command line interface, git and github(Fun facts: I got to know they are not the same company)
 
 Today was fun getting to learn many new things all at once(interesting right)
