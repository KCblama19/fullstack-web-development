I have come to understand that, as a web-developer your worked is typically project base and mostly envolves collaborating with team/teams.

You cam also choose a type of career you would prefer, 
1). You could choose to work with big tech companies( ie: Oracle, Google, Meta, Amazon, etc)
2). You could choose to work with startups.
3). You could choose to work as a freelamcer.
4). You could choose to work as a consultant for web-consultancy.
5). You could choose to work for larger and older tech companies.
6). Or start your company/startup, etc.

As a web developer you should familiarize yourself with the tools of the trade(web development),these tools include but not limited to;
1). Computer
2). Google
3). Text editor
4). Command line interface(CLI)
5). Stackoverflow
6). Git and Github

As a web developer/software engineer/ Programmer, you should always have the desire to solve problems, and explore codes no matter how difficult or furstrated it might get.
Also you will forget things along the way which is natural, but the more you are adjusted to coding the more stronger you becomes and the more fun you will start to have.
Practicing memorization of codes should not be your goal, but rather try to understand and learn the fundamentals of how those codes work.
